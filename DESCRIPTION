Title: An Individual-Based Population Genetic Simulation Environment
License: GPL
Description: An interface between R and the metasim simulation engine.
    The simulation environment is documented in: "A
    Strand. Metasim 1.0: an individual-based environment for
    simulating population genetics of complex population
    dynamics. Mol. Ecol. Notes, 2:373-376, 2002". 
    The current version has eliminated the backend encoded output routines.
    These routines were accessed using "landscape.write.foreign".  Now only
    output to GenePop files remains.  
    R based routines for population data analysis have improved dramatically 
    and many can use the 'genind' format used in the adegenet package. 
    There is now a new function called "landscape.make.genind" which converts
    a landscape to a genind object.  Please contact the maintainer if other
    output formats are needed.
