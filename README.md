# rmetasim  population genetic simulation engine

This software started as a c++ library (Strand, 2002) and has been modified to be a c++ backend and R frontend.  The idea is to provide a flexible environment for designing and running forward-time genetic simulations.  Populations can have complex demography and there can be arbitrary dispersal among them.  Microsatellites, Infinite alleles and sequences can be simulated.
